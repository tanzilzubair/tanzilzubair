My name is Tanzil Zubair Bin Zaman, and I'm a sophomore at Michigan State University with a passion for technology and software - particularly centered on how they can be used to build experiences that inspire and uplift.<br><br> I've been obssessed with technology for as long as I can remember, from being fascinated by how they work, to being in awe of how much they impact our lives and magnify our potential. In my free time, I try to build things that embody these ideals, from websites and mobile apps to open-source libraries and Raspberry Pi creations.

As you can probably tell, I code a lot. I've been doing it for a long time too ‚Äî over 10 years since I wrote that first line ‚Äî and whether it be finishing up a big project late at night, deep into the thick of it, or starting a fresh new project on a lazy afternoon, music has been my companion through it all. 

Also, Spotify as a technology deeply fascinates me, having sparked my love and learning of AI and ML, and how it makes the simple act of listening to magic so seamlessly magical is a design philosophy I try to channel into the software *I* build as well.
