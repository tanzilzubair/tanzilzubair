My name is Tanzil Zubair Bin Zaman, and I'm a sophomore at Michigan State University with a passion for technology and software - particularly centered on how they can be used to build experiences that inspire and uplift.<br><br> I've been obssessed with technology for as long as I can remember, from being fascinated by how they work, to being in awe of how much they impact our lives and magnify our potential. In my free time, I try to build things that embody these ideals, from websites and mobile apps to open-source libraries and Raspberry Pi creations.

# üé∂ What I'm Vibing To Currently

As you can probably tell, I code a lot. I've been doing it for a long time too ‚Äî over 10 years since I wrote that first line ‚Äî and whether it be finishing up a big project late at night, deep into the thick of it, or starting a fresh new project on a lazy afternoon, music has been my companion through it all. 

Also, Spotify as a technology deeply fascinates me, having sparked my love and learning of AI and ML, and how it makes the simple act of listening to magic so seamlessly magical is a design philosophy I try to channel into the software *I* build as well.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Blog & Writing
Apart from coding, I've been an avid fan of the written word for just about as long as I've been able to comprehend it, and over the years, I've won a few writing competitions as well!

Now a love of writing naturally means a love of reading as well, and my favorite books include the timeless and genre-defining works of Isaac Asimov and Frank Herbert, to the I am _convinced_ classic-to-be works of Brandon Sanderson. 
*Dune* and *Mistborn* are books that have kept me awake many-a-night transcending simple stories, these books create entire *worlds* to fall in love with, and that's exactly why I love them so much. The've entertained, they've given companionship, and most importantly, they've shown me the value of not just seeing what _is_, but what _could be_.

I maintain a blog and write sporadically over at [tanzilzubair.tech](tanzilzubair.tech).
